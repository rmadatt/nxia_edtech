Planning for EdTech AI Guardrails 

AI Guardrail Architecture
Data Ingestion:

Collects data from various sources, such as user interactions and external databases.

Preprocessing:

Cleans and preprocesses the data to ensure it's suitable for analysis. This includes removing noise and normalizing values.

Model Training:

Uses machine learning algorithms to train models on the preprocessed data. These models are designed to detect and prevent unethical behavior.

Guardrail Implementation:

Integrates the trained models into the AI system. The guardrails monitor the AI's actions and intervene when necessary to ensure ethical behavior.

Monitoring and Feedback:

Continuously monitors the AI system's performance and collects feedback to improve the guardrails over time.
